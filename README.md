An alternative iOS app for Crédit Coopératif. Because the real one, well, is not that great.

Completely unofficial, don’t complain when it breaks, uses undocumented, non-public, reverse-engineered webservices. Don’t use it if you don’t think you could have written it.

(Also, it’s functionnal, but not really pretty right now.)
